\hypertarget{working-with-r-markdown}{%
\subsection{Working with R Markdown}\label{working-with-r-markdown}}

This is an R Markdown document. The advantage of RMarkdown is that you
can embed R code and the outputs into regular text and convert it into
commonly used document files, including HTML, PDF, MS Word and Power
Point documents. Actually for my slides used in the class, I generated
most of them using RMarkdown. For more details on using R Markdown see
\url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}.

When you click the \textbf{Knit} button a document will be generated
that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(cars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
\end{verbatim}

The most important thing for this class is to know how to embed the R
codes into the regular texts. It is fairly straightforward. You can
simply click \textbf{Insert} button and choose R.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./insertMarkdown.png}
\caption{Insert a R code chunk}
\end{figure}

Or as you can see in the above example, you can place your code with in
a R code chunk indicating by three consective back-tick symbols. In the
parenthesis in the above example, `r' indicating we are using R language
(other languages like Python can actually be used in RStudio too),
`cars' indicates the label for this code chunk and the label is not
required (if left out, RStudio will automatically generate one).

\hypertarget{including-plots}{%
\subsection{Including Plots}\label{including-plots}}

You can also embed plots, for example:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figs/pressure-1} \end{center}

Note that the \texttt{echo\ =\ FALSE} parameter was added to the code
chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. There
are other options that you can use to control how the R and R output
displayed in the final documents:

\texttt{echo=FALSE} Don't include the code

\texttt{results="hide} Don't include the output

\texttt{include=FALSE} Don't show code or output

\texttt{eval=FALSE} Don't evaluate the code at all

\texttt{warning=FALSE} Don't show R warnings

\texttt{message=FALSE} Don't show R messages

\texttt{fig.width=\#} Width of figure

\texttt{fig.height=\#} Height of figure

\texttt{fig.path="Figs/"} Path for figure files

\hypertarget{future-labs-and-homeworks}{%
\subsection{Future labs and homeworks}\label{future-labs-and-homeworks}}

Now click the \textbf{Knit} button and choose \emph{Knit to HTML}. You
will see the Rmd file is rendered as a html file that are much more
pleasant and easier to read. A html file with the same name as the Rmd
file (PartI-IntroRmd for this file) should be saved in your working
folder (type \texttt{getwd()} in the Console to know what your working
directory). Please try to find it.

Now you have some idea how to edit an Rmd file. In the future lab of
this class, most of the lab materials and instructions will be
distributed as Rmd files, and you will return the finished Rmd and the
rendered html file.
